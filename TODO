Post-paper-submission Tasks
===========================

Definitely these:
 * call_py_func is inefficient.
 * Match stock PyPy recursion limit (see branch)
 v Embed py in py should raise (see branch)
 v Embed php in php should raise (see branch)
 * type comparisons using old-style mechanism (branch)
 * Look for bugs we want to fix on the tracker:
   https://bitbucket.org/softdevteam/pypy-hippy-bridge/issues?status=new&status=open
 * Remove set_planner() hack in benchmark.
 * Search for XXX

Maybe these:
 * Make PyHyp work with pip (?)
 * Make it possible to start in Python (?)
 * Maybe clean up exceptions (print better error msgs etc.)

Paper related:
 * Make more benchmarks.
 * Use correct error interval on ACR plots.
 * Re-benchmark
